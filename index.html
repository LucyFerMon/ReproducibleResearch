<p><strong>Actually willing to contribute to your field? Keep reading....</strong>
As you start jumping levels (primary school, secondary school, high school, under-grad, post-grad, PhD, post-doc, professor and..eventually emeritus, if you make it) you start becoming unique...but that basically means, more the broader population, <strong>imposible to understand</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking in a language that nobody understands, might make you feel special, genuine! But...wait! What did you go so far in your career on the very first place? Probably because you were passionate about a topic! (and if not...something went wrong).</p>

<p>So...why would you like to stand now in isolation and keep all your brilliant ideas, data, analysis for yourself? 
I know, I know, authorship, confidentiality, fear that somebody else would actually copy what you did...But to be honest, have you not reached the position you have by learning from others? Haven't you read books, articles, websites, encyclopedias, attended conferences, etc? And haven't you copied (and probably built on) other's work? Eureca! That's how society moves forward! </p>

<p>Nowadays, we are extremely lucky! We live in the internet generation and we can share our achievements instantly online with almost no extra effort. We can build on each others's work, build a huge community and together make better, faster and incredible contributions to a field.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to Reproducible Research</strong></p>

<p>Yes! Your are perfect! Incredibly good in your area of expertise! And know you can share it with the world. The best way to allow others to admire you is by fully sharing whatever your produce (your your code, your data and your methodologies). 
The world is going to admire it..but wait! The world is actually going to benefit from it! Your area of expertise is going to advance faster, and you are going to play a principal role! isn't it exciting?</p>

<p><strong>The path towards reproducibility as a standard way of doing research has started</strong></p>
