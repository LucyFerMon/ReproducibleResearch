{"name":"Reproducible Research","tagline":"Welcome to the first page of my long trip into Reproducible Research ","body":"Why Reproducible Research?\r\n===================================\r\n\r\n## **Actually willing to contribute to your field? Keep reading....**\r\nAs you start jumping levels (primary school, secondary school, high school, under-grad, post-grad, PhD, post-doc, professor and..eventually emeritus, if you make it) you start becoming unique...but that actually means, for the broader population, **impossible to understand**.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in a language that nobody understands might make you feel special, genuine! But...wait! What did you go so far in your career on the very first place? Probably because you were passionate about a topic! (and if not...something went wrong).\r\n\r\nSo...why would you like to stand now in isolation and keep all your brilliant ideas, data, analysis for yourself? \r\nI know, I know, authorship, confidentiality, fear that somebody else would actually copy what you did...But to be honest, have you not reached so high by learning from others? Haven't you read books, articles, websites, encyclopaedias, attended conferences, etc? And haven't you copied (and probably built on and improved) other's work? Eureka! That's how society moves forward! \r\n\r\nNowadays, we are extremely lucky! We live in the internet generation and we can share our achievements instantly online with almost no extra effort. We can build on each others's work, build a huge community and together make better, faster and more creative and incredible contributions to a field.\r\n\r\n##**Welcome to Reproducible Research**\r\n\r\nYes! Your are perfect! Incredibly good in your area of expertise! And now you can share it with the world. The best way to allow others to admire you is by fully sharing whatever your produce (your code, your data and your methodologies). \r\nThe world is going to admire it..but wait! The world is actually going to benefit from it! Your area of expertise is going to advance breakneck speed, and you are going to play a principal role! isn't it exciting?\r\n\r\n##**The path towards reproducibility as a standard way of doing research has started**\r\n\r\nAnd here is my first contribution [contribution](https://github.com/LucyFerMon/ReproducibleResearch) and here is my first online, transparent [report](https://rpubs.com/LucyFerMon/StormsBurdenUSA). Of course is just an starting point,an exercise, but with the numerous open-source tools that the community has built and is building nowadays, it is just the first step into the development of my new way of presenting and sharing information. A way that I hope is the clearest and most efficient for all of you.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in breaking into the world of Reproducible Research, this [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata) is a perfect introduction into the topic, a door open into a new way of sharing information.\r\n\r\n**WELCOME!!** and hope to see your codes, analysis, reports and data soon in the cloud!\r\n\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
